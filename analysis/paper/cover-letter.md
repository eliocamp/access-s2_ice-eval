Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit our manuscript, "The Importance of Initial Conditions in Seasonal Predictions of Antarctic Sea Ice," for consideration in npj climate and atmospheric science. 

This work addresses a critical gap in understanding the role of initial conditions in Antarctic sea-ice predictability by taking advantage of a unique "opportunistic experiment" with the ACCESS-S1 and ACCESS-S2 forecast systems. 
Our findings have direct implications for operational forecasting and model development, particularly regarding data assimilation strategies and seasonal predictability barriers.

We suggest the following potential reviewers:

1. Marika Holland \<mholland@ucar.edu\>
1. Andrea Barreira \<barreira@ara.mil.ar\>
1. Marilyn Raphael \<raphael@geog.ucla.edu\>

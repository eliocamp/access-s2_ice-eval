  abstract = {Skillful sea ice forecasts from days to years ahead are becoming increasingly important for the operation and planning of human activities in the Arctic. Here we analyze the potential predictability of the Arctic sea ice edge in six climate models. We introduce the integrated ice-edge error (IIEE), a user-relevant verification metric defined as the area where the forecast and the ``truth'' disagree on the ice concentration being above or below 15\%. The IIEE lends itself to decomposition into an absolute extent error, corresponding to the common sea ice extent error, and a misplacement error. We find that the often-neglected misplacement error makes up more than half of the climatological IIEE. In idealized forecast ensembles initialized on 1 July, the IIEE grows faster than the absolute extent error. This means that the Arctic sea ice edge is less predictable than sea ice extent, particularly in September, with implications for the potential skill of end-user relevant forecasts.},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

  abstract = {ACCESS-S1 will be the next version of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal prediction system, due to become operational in early 2018. The multiweek and seasonal performance of ACCESS-S1 has been evaluated based on a 23-year hindcast set and compared to the current operational system, POAMA. The system has considerable enhancements compared to POAMA, including higher vertical and horizontal resolution of the component models and state-ofthe-art physics parameterisation schemes. ACCESS-S1 is based on the UK Met Office GloSea5-GC2 seasonal prediction system, but has enhancements to the ensemble generation strategy to make it appropriate for multi-week forecasting, and a larger ensemble size. ACCESS-S1 has markedly reduced biases in the mean state of the climate, both globally and over Australia, compared to POAMA. ACCESS-S1 also better predicts the early stages of the development of the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (through the predictability barrier) and the Indian Ocean Dipole, as well as multi-week variations of the Southern Annular Mode and the Madden-Julian Oscillation --- all important drivers of Australian climate variability. There is an overall improvement in the skill of the forecasts of rainfall, maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) over Australia on multi-week timescales compared to POAMA. On seasonal timescales the differences between the two systems are generally less marked. ACCESS-S1 has improved seasonal forecasts over Australia for the austral spring season compared to POAMA, with particularly good forecast reliability for rainfall and Tmax. However, forecasts of seasonal mean Tmax are noticeably less skilful over eastern Australia for forecasts of late autumn and winter compared to POAMA. The study has identified scope for improvement of ACCESS-S in the future, particularly 1) reducing rainfall errors in the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent regions, and 2) initialising the land surface with realistic soil moisture rather than climatology. The latter impacts negatively on the skill of the temperature forecasts over eastern Australia and is being addressed in the next version of the system, ACCESS-S2.},

  abstract = {ACCESS-S2 is a major upgrade to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's multi-week to seasonal prediction system. It was made operational in October 2021, replacing ACCESS-S1. The focus of the upgrade is the addition of a new weakly coupled data assimilation system to provide initial conditions for atmosphere, ocean, land and ice fields. The model is based on the UK Met Office GloSea5-GC2 seasonal prediction system and is unchanged from ACCESS-S1, aside from minor corrections and enhancements. The performance of the assimilation system and the skill of the seasonal and multi-week forecasts have been assessed and compared to ACCESS-S1. There are improvements in the ACCESS-S2 initial conditions compared to ACCESS-S1, particularly for soil moisture and aspects of the ocean, notably the ocean currents. More realistic soil moisture initialisation has led to increased skill for forecasts over Australia, especially those of maximum temperature. The ACCESS-S2 system is shown to have increased skill of El Nino--Southern Oscillation forecasts over ACCESS-S1 during the challenging autumn forecast period. Analysis suggests that ACCESS-S2 will deliver improved operational forecast accuracy in comparison to ACCESS-S1. Assessments of the operational forecasts are underway. ACCESS-S2 represents another step forward in the development of seasonal forecast systems at the Bureau of Meteorology. However, key rainfall and sea surface temperature biases in ACCESS-S1 remain in ACCESS-S2, indicating where future efforts should be focused.},

  abstract = {Antarctic sea ice cover is projected to significantly decrease by the end of the twenty-first century if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise, with potential consequences for Southern Hemisphere weather and climate. Here we examine the atmospheric response to projected Antarctic sea ice loss at quadrupled CO2, inferred from 11 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 models. Our study is the first multimodel analysis of the atmospheric response to Antarctic sea ice loss. Projected sea ice loss enhances the negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode, which slightly damps the positive Southern Annular Mode response to increased CO2, particularly in spring. The negative Southern Annular Mode response largely reflects a weakening of the eddy-driven jet, and to a lesser extent, an equatorward shift of the jet. Sea ice loss induces near-surface warming over the high-latitude Southern Ocean, but warming does not penetrate over the Antarctic continent. In spring, we find multimodel evidence for a weakened polar stratospheric vortex in response to sea ice loss.},

  abstract = {Abstract Antarctic sea ice is projected to decrease in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Limited studies so far have examined the coupled atmosphere--ocean response to Antarctic sea ice loss. Here, we isolate the response to Antarctic sea ice loss in the atmosphere and ocean using bespoke sea ice albedo perturbation experiments with HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL, provide the first detailed examination of the global ocean response, and quantify the importance of atmosphere--ocean coupling, through comparison to uncoupled experiments with prescribed Antarctic sea ice loss. Lower-tropospheric warming and moistening over regions of sea ice loss and the nearby Southern Ocean are simulated in both coupled and uncoupled configurations but are of greater magnitude in the coupled model. A weakening and equatorward shift of the tropospheric westerly jet are simulated in both configurations, but are also larger in the coupled model. Ocean coupling allows the warming response to spread northward, and by poleward atmospheric energy transport, back to the Antarctic interior. Warmer tropical sea surface temperatures enhance atmospheric convection, driving upper-tropospheric warming and triggering atmospheric teleconnections to the extratropics, including a weakened Aleutian low. A 20\% reduction in Antarctic Circumpolar Current transport and a weakening of the shallow tropical convergence cell are simulated. Surface waters warm and freshen globally, becoming more stratified and stable in the Southern Ocean, with similar changes, but of lesser magnitude, in the Arctic Ocean, where sea ice declines. Our results suggest that the climate effects of Antarctic sea ice loss stretch from pole to pole and from the heights of the tropical troposphere to the depths of the Southern Ocean.},

Such large environmental changes are already having profound impacts on the flora, fauna, and inhabitants of the Arctic region. An open question, however, is whether these Arctic changes have an effect on the jet-stream and thereby influence weather patterns farther south. This broad question has recently received a lot of scientific and media attention, but conclusions appear contradictory rather than consensual. We argue that one point of confusion has arisen due to ambiguities in the exact question being posed. In this study, we frame our inquiries around three distinct questions: Can Arctic warming influence the midlatitude jet-stream? Has Arctic warming significantly influenced the midlatitude jet-stream? Will Arctic warming significantly influence the midlatitude jet-stream? We argue that framing the discussion around the three questions: Can it?, Has it?, and Will it? provides insight into the common themes emerging in the literature as well as highlights the challenges ahead.

To do so, we initialize hindcast simulations with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model every 1 May and 1 November from 1981 to 2011 with two different sea ice concentration data sets, one based on the NASA Team and one on the Bootstrap algorithm. For hindcasts started in November, initial differences in Arctic sea ice area and surface temperature decrease rapidly throughout the freezing period. For hindcasts started in May, initial differences in sea ice area increase over time. By the end of the melting period, this causes significant differences in 2 meter air temperature of regionally more than 3{$^\circ$}C. Hindcast skill for surface temperatures over Europe and North America is higher with Bootstrap initialization during summer and with NASA Team initialization during winter. This implies that the observational uncertainty also affects forecasts of teleconnections that depend on northern hemispheric climate indices.},

  abstract = {Compared to the Arctic, seasonal predictions of Antarctic sea ice have received relatively little attention. In this work, we utilize three coupled dynamical prediction systems developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory to assess the seasonal prediction skill and predictability of Antarctic sea ice. These systems, based on the FLOR, SPEAR\_LO, and SPEAR\_MED dynamical models, differ in their coupled model components, initialization techniques, atmospheric resolution, and model biases. Using suites of retrospective initialized seasonal predictions spanning 1992--2018, we investigate the role of these factors in determining Antarctic sea ice prediction skill and examine the mechanisms of regional sea ice predictability. We find that each system is capable of skillfully predicting regional Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE) with skill that exceeds a persistence forecast. Winter SIE is skillfully predicted 11 months in advance in the Weddell, Amundsen/Bellingshausen, Indian, and west Pacific sectors, whereas winter skill is notably lower in the Ross sector. Zonally advected upper-ocean heat content anomalies are found to provide the crucial source of prediction skill for the winter sea ice edge position. The recently developed SPEAR systems are more skillful than FLOR for summer sea ice predictions, owing to improvements in sea ice concentration and sea ice thickness initialization. Summer Weddell SIE is skillfully predicted up to 9 months in advance in SPEAR\_MED, due to the persistence and drift of initialized sea ice thickness anomalies from the previous winter. Overall, these results suggest a promising potential for providing operational Antarctic sea ice predictions on seasonal time scales.},

  abstract = {A method of determining sea ice parameters using dual-polarized multispectral radiance data obtained with the NIMBUS 7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) is presented. Sea ice concentration is determined both at a 60-km resolution from the polarization at the 1.7-cm wavelength and at a 30-km resolution using the polarization at the 0.81-cm wavelength. Multiyear sea ice fraction is obtained from the spectral gradient ratio, which is the difference of the 0.81 cm and the 1.7 cm vertically polarized radiances divided by their sum. In addition, an ice temperature is calculated from the 4.6-cm vertical channel radiances. The use of radiance ratios greatly reduces uncertainties in the derived parameters resulting from temporal and horizontal spatial variations of ice temperature. Observed SMMR radiances from selected areas in the Arctic region for the period February 3--7, 1979, are used in computing algorithm coefficients. Polar maps of sea ice concentration, multiyear fraction, and ice temperature are illustrated for this period. The variation of the mean and standard deviation of ice concentration and multiyear ice fraction for a region of perennial ice cover over the first 11 months of SMMR operation is also presented. The standard deviation about the mean for the computed concentration varies from 2 to 5\% over the 11-month period, while that of the multiyear fraction is about 8\% for all but the summer months. Discrimination between first-year and multiyear sea ice during the summer period is indeterminate largely because the general surface melt conditions mask the distinguishing properties of the two ice types. Based on the time variation of ice concentration and multiyear fraction for the central Arctic region and on an analysis of histograms of these parameters, the precision of the calculated ice concentration is estimated to be in the range of 5--9\% and that of the multiyear fraction in the range of 13--25\%. Comparisons are made between the calculated sea ice parameters and information obtained from previous studies using aircraft, submarine, and surface observations. From these comparisons it is concluded that the absolute accuracy of the SMMR parameters remains uncertain. The precision of the sea ice concentration is sufficient to provide useful data on the large-scale polar ice cover, but further study is required to increase the confidence in the multiyear ice fraction which at present contains significant uncertainties.},

However, coupled seasonal forecast systems do not generally use sea ice thickness observations in their initialization and are therefore missing a potentially important source of additional skill. To investigate how large this source is, a set of ensemble potential predictability experiments with a global climate model, initialized with and without knowledge of the sea ice thickness initial state, have been run. These experiments show that accurate knowledge of the sea ice thickness field is crucially important for sea ice concentration and extent forecasts up to 8 months ahead, especially in summer. Perturbing sea ice thickness also has a significant impact on the forecast error in Arctic 2 m temperature a few months ahead. These results suggest that advancing capabilities to observe and assimilate sea ice thickness into coupled forecast systems could significantly increase skill.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects.

Early winter dynamics and thermodynamics can cause sea ice conditions to change over short timescales. Heavy ice pressure may build up in the compression of compact ice. MIRAI is an ice-strengthened ship that has to avoid thick sea ice and areas of high sea ice coverage, and therefore precise medium-range forecast of sea ice distribution is key to its safe and efficient navigation. A high-resolution (about 2.5 km) coupled ice--ocean model was used to produce medium-range (10-day) forecasts for the expedition. European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast's atmospheric model high-resolution 10-day forecast was used as forcing data. Forecast skill is measured by ice edge error, which is the average distance between forecast and observed ice edges. Using a threshold of 15\% sea ice concentration to indicate the ice edge, the maximum ice edge error in the ice--ocean coupled model in the Chukchi Sea is 16 km, indicating that the model is able to provide 10-day forecasts with sufficient accuracy for the vessel's operation.},

Here, the atmospheric response to future sea ice loss in the Antarctic is investigated, and contrasted to the Arctic case, using the Community Earth Systems Model (CESM) Whole Atmosphere Coupled Climate Model (WACCM). Time-slice model runs with historic sea ice concentrations are compared to runs with future concentrations, from the late twenty-first century, in each hemisphere separately. As for the Arctic, results indicate that Antarctic sea ice loss will act to shift the tropospheric jet equatorward, an internal negative feedback to the poleward shift associated with increased greenhouse gases. Also, the tropospheric response to Antarctic sea ice loss is found to be somewhat weaker, more vertically confined, and less seasonally varying than in the case of Arctic sea ice loss. The stratospheric response to Antarctic sea ice loss is relatively weak compared to the Arctic case, although it is here demonstrated that the latter is still small relative to internal variability. In contrast to the Arctic case, the response of the ozone layer is found to be positive (up to 5 Dobson units): interestingly, it is present in all seasons except austral spring. Finally, while the response of surface temperature and precipitation is limited to the southern high latitudes, it is nonetheless unable to impact the interior of the Antarctic continent, suggesting a minor role of sea ice loss on recent Antarctic temperature trends.},

The effects of Arctic sea-ice loss are not limited to the northern high latitudes, and reach deep into the tropics. Yet little is known about the effects of future Antarctic sea-ice loss outside of the southern high latitudes. Here, using a fully coupled climate model, we investigate the tropical response to Antarctic sea-ice loss and compare it with the response to Arctic sea-ice loss. We show that Antarctic sea-ice loss, similar to Arctic sea-ice loss, causes enhanced warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific and an equatorward intensification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. We demonstrate that Antarctic sea-ice loss causes a mini global warming signal comparable to the one caused by Arctic sea-ice loss, and reminiscent of the response to greenhouse gases. We also show that ocean dynamics are key to capturing the tropical response to sea-ice loss. In short, we find that future Antarctic sea-ice loss will exert a profound influence on the tropics. Combined Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice losses will account for 20--30\% of the projected tropical warming and precipitation changes under the high-emissions scenario Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5.},

  abstract = {The Southern Ocean occupies 14\% of the Earth's surface and plays a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle and climate. It provides a direct connection to the deep ocean carbon reservoir through biogeochemical processes that include surface primary productivity, remineralization at depth and the upwelling of carbon-rich water masses. However, the role of these different processes in modulating past and future air--sea carbon flux remains poorly understood. A key period in this regard is the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, 14.6--12.7\,kyr bp), when mid- to high-latitude Southern Hemisphere cooling coincided with a sustained plateau in the global deglacial increase in atmospheric CO2. Here we reconstruct high-latitude Southern Ocean surface productivity from marine-derived aerosols captured in a highly resolved horizontal ice core. Our multiproxy reconstruction reveals a sustained signal of enhanced marine productivity across the ACR. Transient climate modelling indicates this period coincided with maximum seasonal variability in sea-ice extent, implying that sea-ice biological feedbacks enhanced CO2 sequestration and created a substantial regional marine carbon sink, which contributed to the plateau in CO2 during the ACR. Our results highlight the role Antarctic sea ice plays in controlling global CO2, and demonstrate the need to incorporate such feedbacks into climate--carbon models.},

We introduce the integrated ice-edge error (IIEE), a user-relevant verification metric defined as the area where the forecast and the ``truth'' disagree on the ice concentration being above or below 15\%. The IIEE lends itself to decomposition into an absolute extent error, corresponding to the common sea ice extent error, and a misplacement error. We find that the often-neglected misplacement error makes up more than half of the climatological IIEE. In idealized forecast ensembles initialized on 1 July, the IIEE grows faster than the absolute extent error. This means that the Arctic sea ice edge is less predictable than sea ice extent, particularly in September, with implications for the potential skill of end-user relevant forecasts.},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

This trend is dominated by increased sea ice coverage in the western Ross Sea, and is mitigated by a strong decrease in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas. The trends in sea ice areal coverage are accompanied by related trends in yearly duration. These changes have implications for ecosystems, as well as global and regional climate. In this review, we summarise the research to date on observing these trends, identifying their drivers, and assessing the role of anthropogenic climate change. Whilst the atmosphere is thought to be the primary driver, the ocean is also essential in explaining the seasonality of the trend patterns. Detecting an anthropogenic signal in Antarctic sea ice is particularly challenging for a number of reasons: the expected response is small compared to the very high natural variability of the system; the observational record is relatively short; and the ability of global coupled climate models to faithfully represent the complex Antarctic climate system is in doubt.},

  abstract = {Abstract In recent years, the Southern Ocean has experienced extremely low sea ice cover in multiple summers. These low events were preceded by a multidecadal positive trend that culminated in record high ice coverage in 2014. This abrupt transition has led some authors to suggest that Antarctic sea ice has undergone a regime shift. In this study we analyze the satellite sea ice record and atmospheric reanalyses to assess the evidence for such a shift. We find that the standard deviation of the summer sea ice record has doubled from 0.31 million km2 in 1979--2006 to 0.76 million km2 for 2007--22. This increased variance is accompanied by a longer season-to-season sea ice memory. The atmosphere is the primary driver of Antarctic sea ice variability, but using a linear predictive model we show that sea ice changes cannot be explained by the atmosphere alone. Identifying whether a regime shift has occurred is difficult without a complete understanding of the physical mechanism of change. However, the statistical changes that we demonstrate (i.e., increased variance and autocorrelation, and a changed response to atmospheric forcing), as well as the increased spatial coherence noted by previous research, are indicators based on dynamical systems theory of an abrupt critical transition. Thus, our analysis is further evidence in support of a changed Antarctic sea ice system. Significance Statement In recent years, there have been several summers with extremely low Antarctic sea ice cover, including consecutive record lows in February 2022 and February 2023. Since then, the 2023 winter has seen a remarkably low sea ice growth with an anomaly far below expected climatology. This has led researchers to question whether there has been a regime shift, and we assess the observational evidence for such a shift. In the last decade or so, the variability of summer sea ice has almost doubled, accompanied by a much longer sea ice memory from season to season. These statistical changes, as well an increased spatial coherence noted by other researchers, are consistent with theoretical indicators of a critical transition, or regime shift.},

We find that the initialized ice-ocean state provides predictive capability on the ice-edge location around Antarctica for the first several months of integration. During the ice advance season from April to September, significant predictability is retained in some locations with an eastward propagating signal. This is consistent with previous work suggesting the advection of sea ice anomalies with the mean ocean circulation. The ice-edge predictability is then generally lost during the ice retreat season after October. However, predictability reemerges during the next year's ice advance starting around June in some locations. This reemergence is associated with ocean heat content anomalies that are retained at depth during the austral summer and resurface during the following autumn as the ocean mixed layers deepen.},

The multiweek and seasonal performance of ACCESS-S1 has been evaluated based on a 23-year hindcast set and compared to the current operational system, POAMA. The system has considerable enhancements compared to POAMA, including higher vertical and horizontal resolution of the component models and state-ofthe-art physics parameterisation schemes. ACCESS-S1 is based on the UK Met Office GloSea5-GC2 seasonal prediction system, but has enhancements to the ensemble generation strategy to make it appropriate for multi-week forecasting, and a larger ensemble size. ACCESS-S1 has markedly reduced biases in the mean state of the climate, both globally and over Australia, compared to POAMA. ACCESS-S1 also better predicts the early stages of the development of the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (through the predictability barrier) and the Indian Ocean Dipole, as well as multi-week variations of the Southern Annular Mode and the Madden-Julian Oscillation --- all important drivers of Australian climate variability. There is an overall improvement in the skill of the forecasts of rainfall, maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) over Australia on multi-week timescales compared to POAMA. On seasonal timescales the differences between the two systems are generally less marked. ACCESS-S1 has improved seasonal forecasts over Australia for the austral spring season compared to POAMA, with particularly good forecast reliability for rainfall and Tmax. However, forecasts of seasonal mean Tmax are noticeably less skilful over eastern Australia for forecasts of late autumn and winter compared to POAMA. The study has identified scope for improvement of ACCESS-S in the future, particularly 1) reducing rainfall errors in the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent regions, and 2) initialising the land surface with realistic soil moisture rather than climatology. The latter impacts negatively on the skill of the temperature forecasts over eastern Australia and is being addressed in the next version of the system, ACCESS-S2.},

This study describes several approaches to improve how model biases in total sea ice distribution are quantified, and applies them to historically forced simulations contributed to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The quantity of hemispheric total sea ice area, or some measure of its equatorward extent, is often used to evaluate model performance. A new approach is introduced that investigates additional details about the structure of model errors, with an aim to reduce the potential impact of compensating errors when gauging differences between simulated and observed sea ice. Using multiple observational datasets, several new methods are applied to evaluate the climatological spatial distribution and the annual cycle of sea ice cover in 41 CMIP5 models. It is shown that in some models, error compensation can be substantial, for example resulting from too much sea ice in one region and too little in another. Error compensation tends to be larger in models that agree more closely with the observed total sea ice area, which may result from model tuning. The results herein suggest that consideration of only the total hemispheric sea ice area or extent can be misleading when quantitatively comparing how well models agree with observations. Further work is needed to fully develop robust methods to holistically evaluate the ability of models to capture the finescale structure of sea ice characteristics; however, the ``sector scale'' metric used here aids in reducing the impact of compensating errors in hemispheric integrals.},

Progress has been made towards establishing the causes of ice loss1--5 but uncertainty remains about its consequences for ocean--atmosphere interaction. Resolution of this uncertainty is important as ice decline can substantially alter surface heat loss and thus the ocean and atmosphere6. Here we show that the strongest winter 2023 ice-retraction regions provide an important new source of turbulent ocean heat loss to the atmosphere in wintertime. Ice concentration in these regions (located primarily in the Weddell, Bellingshausen and Ross seas) is reduced by up to 80\% and is accompanied by an unprecedented doubling of mid-winter ocean heat loss. Also, there is a phase shift in the time of peak heat loss from late April to mid-June, with weaker than normal heat loss in austral autumn. The winter surface-heat-loss intensification is accompanied by substantial changes on both sides of the ocean--atmosphere interface. These include increases in atmospheric-storm frequency and surface-heat-loss-driven dense water formation, although the implications of the densification for broader processes such as Antarctic bottom water formation remain unclear. Our results reveal that the 2023 Antarctic sea-ice loss has substantially modified air--sea interaction in the Southern Ocean and motivate in-depth analysis of the wider climate-system impacts.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Antarctic sea ice prediction has garnered increasing attention in recent years, particularly in the context of the recent record lows of February 2022 and 2023. As Antarctica becomes a climate change hotspot, as polar tourism booms, and as scientific expeditions continue to explore this remote continent, the capacity to anticipate sea ice conditions weeks to months in advance is in increasing demand. Spurred by recent studies that uncovered physical mechanisms of Antarctic sea ice predictability and by the intriguing large variations of the observed sea ice extent in recent years, the Sea Ice Prediction Network South (SIPN South) project was initiated in 2017, building upon the Arctic Sea Ice Prediction Network. The SIPN South project annually coordinates spring-to-summer predictions of Antarctic sea ice conditions, to allow robust evaluation and intercomparison, and to guide future development in polar prediction systems. In this paper, we present and discuss the initial SIPN South results collected over six summer seasons (December-February 2017-2018 to 2022-2023). We use data from 22 unique contributors spanning five continents that have together delivered more than 3000 individual forecasts of sea ice area and concentration. The SIPN South median forecast of the circumpolar sea ice area captures the sign of the recent negative anomalies, and the verifying observations are systematically included in the 10-90\% range of the forecast distribution. These statements also hold at the regional level except in the Ross Sea where the systematic biases and the ensemble spread are the largest. A notable finding is that the group forecast, constructed by aggregating the data provided by each contributor, outperforms most of the individual forecasts, both at the circumpolar and regional levels. This indicates the value of combining predictions to average out model-specific errors. Finally, we find that dynamical model predictions (i.e., based on process-based general circulation models) generally perform worse than statistical model predictions (i.e., data-driven empirical models including machine learning) in representing the regional variability of sea ice concentration in summer. SIPN South is a collaborative community project that is hosted on a shared public repository. The forecast and verification data used in SIPN South are publicly available in near-real time for further use by the polar research community, and eventually, policymakers.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The configuration has been developed with the seamless approach to modelling in mind for ocean modelling across timescales and for a range of applications, from short-range ocean forecasting through seasonal forecasting to climate predictions as well as research use. The configuration has been coupled with sea ice (GSI5.0), atmosphere (GA5.0), and land-surface (GL5.0) configurations to form a standard coupled global model (GC1). The GO5.0 model will become the basis for the ocean model component of the Forecasting Ocean Assimilation Model, which provides forced short-range forecasting services. The GC1 or future releases of it will be used in coupled short-range ocean forecasting, seasonal forecasting, decadal prediction and for climate prediction as part of the UK Earth System Model.   A 30-year integration of GO5.0, run with CORE2 (Common Ocean-ice Reference Experiments) surface forcing from 1976 to 2005, is described, and the performance of the model in the final 10 years of the integration is evaluated against observations and against a comparable integration of an existing standard configuration, GO1. An additional set of 10-year sensitivity studies, carried out to attribute changes in the model performance to individual changes in the model physics, is also analysed. GO5.0 is found to have substantially reduced subsurface drift above the depth of the thermocline relative to GO1, and also shows a significant improvement in the representation of the annual cycle of surface temperature and mixed layer depth.},

The CDR concentrations do have some differences from the constituent GSFC concentrations, but trends and variability are not substantially different.Keywords: Sea ice; Arctic and Antarctic oceans; climate data record; evaluation; passive microwave remote sensing.(Published: 22 December 2014)Citation: Polar Research 2014, 33, 21004, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/polar.v33.21004},

  abstract = {The uncertainties in sea ice extent (total area covered by sea ice with concentration {$>$}15\%) derived from passive microwave sensors are assessed in two ways. Absolute uncertainty (accuracy) is evaluated based on the comparison of the extent between several products. There are clear biases between the extent from the different products that are of the order of 500 000 to 1 {\texttimes} 106 km2 depending on the season and hemisphere. These biases are due to differences in the algorithm sensitivity to ice edge conditions and the spatial resolution of different sensors. Relative uncertainty is assessed by examining extents from the National Snow and Ice Data Center Sea Ice Index product. The largest source of uncertainty, {$\sim$}100 000 km2, is between near-real-time and final products due to different input source data and different processing and quality control. For consistent processing, the uncertainty is assessed using different input source data and by varying concentration algorithm parameters. This yields a relative uncertainty of 30 000--70 000 km2. The Arctic minimum extent uncertainty is {$\sim$}40 000 km2. Uncertainties in comparing with earlier parts of the record may be higher due to sensor transitions. For the first time, this study provides a quantitative estimate of sea ice extent uncertainty.},

Following the summer minimum, circumpolar Antarctic sea ice coverage remained exceptionally low during the autumn~and winter advance, leading to the largest negative areal extent anomalies observed~over the satellite era. Here, we show the confluence of Southern Ocean subsurface warming and record minima and suggest that ocean warming has played a role in pushing Antarctic sea ice into a new low-extent state. In addition, this new state exhibits different seasonal persistence characteristics, suggesting that the underlying processes controlling Antarctic sea ice coverage may have altered.},

Maximum and minimum sea-ice extremes were obtained from satellite-derived data, and a 12-month climatology for each case was created. Two 10-year simulations for each scenario were completed, and the results for the southern summer are compared. At the surface the sea-ice extremes directly affected the temperatures around Antarctica and through these the latitudinal surface temperature and pressure gradients. The midlatitude surface westerlies are weaker in the maximum scenario, while the polar easterlies expand farther north. In the middle troposphere the zonal jet strengthens slightly and shifts equatorward in the maximum scenario. Comparisons of the sea level pressure field and the 500 hPa geopotential height field for the two scenarios show that the leading mode of circulation variability, the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode, tends toward positive polarity (lower than normal geopotential heights over Antarctica) in the minimum sea-ice scenario. This tendency is associated with local differences in surface pressure gradient and temperature and large scale dynamic responses to extremes of sea-ice concentration.},

Three 150-year simulations were completed for maximum, minimum and average sea ice concentrations and the results for the austral summer (January--March) were compared using the surface temperatures forced by the sea ice distributions as a filter for creating the composite differences. The results indicate that in the austral summer the polar cell expands (contracts) under minimum (maximum) sea ice conditions with corresponding shifts in the midlatitude Ferrell cell. We suggest that this response occurs because sea ice lies in the margin between the polar and midlatitude cells. The polarity of the Southern Hemisphere Annular (SAM) mode is also influenced such that when sea ice is at a minimum (maximum) the polarity of the SAM tends to be negative (positive).},

Using the observed sea ice concentration data, this research isolates distinct regions of sea ice variability around Antarctica and determines the advance and retreat periods for each of them. The latter are then statistically linked with the observed geopotential height data to determine the atmospheric circulation pattern associated with the variability in the sea ice for each period and region. The results clarify which circulation mechanism is of primary importance to sea ice variability during critical periods of the ice lifecycle in the different regions around Antarctica and have potential for making estimates of past sea ice extent using the observed geopotential height data.},

Identifying any relationship over the short satellite period is difficult due to sampling variability and anthropogenic modification of the austral polar vortex. To circumvent these issues, we use large ensembles of fixed boundary condition simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) and Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to assess if and how interannual fluctuations in winter Antarctic sea ice influence spring planetary-scale waves and the coupled stratosphere-troposphere circulation. Low Antarctic sea ice conditions are found to modulate tropospheric stationary waves to project constructively onto the climatological stationary wave, enhancing upward planetary wave propagation into the austral polar stratosphere. In WACCM, the resulting vortex weakening coincides with development of negative Southern Annular Mode conditions during September--November.},

The analyses have a spatial grid resolution of 0.25{$^\circ$} and a temporal resolution of 1 day. One product uses the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1{$^\circ$} OI analyses. The AVHRR-only product uses Pathfinder AVHRR data (currently available from January 1985 to December 2005) and operational AVHRR data for 2006 onward. Pathfinder AVHRR was chosen over operational AVHRR, when available, because Pathfinder agrees better with the in situ data. The AMSR--AVHRR product begins with the start of AMSR data in June 2002. In this product, the primary AVHRR contribution is in regions near land where AMSR is not available. However, in cloud-free regions, use of both infrared and microwave instruments can reduce systematic biases because their error characteristics are independent.},

Many models capture key characteristics of the mean seasonal cycle of sea ice area (SIA), but some simulate implausible historical mean states compared to satellite observations, leading to large intermodel spread. Summer SIA is consistently biased low across the ensemble. Compared to the previous model generation (CMIP5), the intermodel spread in winter and summer SIA has reduced, and the regional distribution of sea ice concentration has improved. Over 1979--2018, many models simulate strong negative trends in SIA concurrently with stronger-than-observed trends in global mean surface temperature (GMST). By the end of the 21st century, models project clear differences in sea ice between forcing scenarios.},

  abstract = {The possibility that Arctic sea ice loss weakens mid-latitude westerlies, promoting more severe cold winters, has sparked more than a decade of scientific debate, with apparent support from observations but inconclusive modelling evidence. Here we show that sixteen models contributing to the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project simulate a weakening of mid-latitude westerlies in response to projected Arctic sea ice loss. We develop an emergent constraint based on eddy feedback, which is 1.2 to 3 times too weak in the models, suggesting that the real-world weakening lies towards the higher end of the model simulations. Still, the modelled response to Arctic sea ice loss is weak: the North Atlantic Oscillation response is similar in magnitude and offsets the projected response to increased greenhouse gases, but would only account for around 10\% of variations in individual years. We further find that relationships between Arctic sea ice and atmospheric circulation have weakened recently in observations and are no longer inconsistent with those in models.},

  abstract = {The impact of Antarctic sea ice reduction during early austral winter on the austral winter Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex is investigated using reanalysis data set and model simulations. Both reanalysis data set and model simulations show that the reduction of Antarctic sea ice during early austral winter leads to a northward displacement of the tropospheric mid-latitude jet, resembling the negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode. Meanwhile, the reduction of sea ice induces a weaker Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex during winter, which is accompanied by a weaker polar night jet. Further analysis indicates that the Antarctic sea ice reduction could lead to a greater excitation of Rossby waves and significant positive geopotential height anomalies over the Antarctic continent. The zonal wave 1 and 2 components of geopotential height anomalies are in phase with the climatology, corresponding to enhanced upward propagation of wave activity flux in early austral winter. Meanwhile, the reduction of sea ice in early austral winter could result in a more favorable atmospheric environment for the propagation of planetary waves into the stratosphere. These processes ultimately weaken the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and the polar night jet in winter. The reduction of sea ice in the Amundsen Sea sector enhances the upward propagation of planetary wave, while the reduction of sea ice in the Indian Ocean sector has the opposite effect.},

  abstract = {Sea ice is a key habitat in the high latitude Southern Ocean and is predicted to change in its extent, thickness and duration in coming decades. The sea-ice cover is instrumental in mediating ocean--atmosphere exchanges and provides an important substrate for organisms from microbes and algae to predators. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is reliant on sea ice during key phases of its life cycle, particularly during the larval stages, for food and refuge from their predators, while other small grazers, including copepods and amphipods, either live in the brine channel system or find food and shelter at the ice-water interface and in gaps between rafted ice blocks. Fish, such as the Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum, use platelet ice (loosely-formed frazil crystals) as an essential hatching and nursery ground. In this paper, we apply the framework of the Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean (MEASO) to review current knowledge about relationships between sea ice and associated primary production and secondary consumers, their status and the drivers of sea-ice change in this ocean. We then use qualitative network modelling to explore possible responses of lower trophic level sea-ice biota to different perturbations, including warming air and ocean temperatures, increased storminess and reduced annual sea-ice duration. This modelling shows that pelagic algae, copepods, krill and fish are likely to decrease in response to warming temperatures and reduced sea-ice duration, while salp populations will likely increase under conditions of reduced sea-ice duration and increased number of days of \&gt;0{$^\circ$}C. Differences in responses to these pressures between the five MEASO sectors were also explored. Greater impacts of environmental pressures on ice-related biota occurring presently were found for the West and East Pacific sectors (notably the Ross Sea and western Antarctic Peninsula), with likely flow-on effects to the wider ecosystem. All sectors are expected to be impacted over coming decades. Finally, we highlight priorities for future sea ice biological research to address knowledge gaps in this field.},

This is anticipated to result in further challenges for maritime safety. Those operating in ice-infested waters require various types of information for sea-ice and iceberg hazards. Ice information requirements depend on regional needs and whether the stakeholder wants to avoid ice all together, operate near or in the Marginal Ice Zone, or areas within the ice pack. An insight into user needs demonstrates how multiple spatial and temporal resolutions for sea-ice information and forecasts are necessary to provide information to the marine operating community for safety, planning, and situational awareness. Although ship-operators depend on sea-ice information for tactical navigation, stakeholders working in route and capacity planning can benefit from climatological and long-range forecast information at lower spatial and temporal resolutions where the interest is focused on open-water season. The advent of the Polar Code has brought with it additional information requirements, and exposed gaps in capacity and knowledge. Thus, future satellite data sources should be at resolutions that support both tactical and planning activities.},

NEMOVAR assimilates observations of sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface height (SSH), in situ temperature and salinity profiles and sea ice concentration. The Met Office is the first centre to implement NEMOVAR at 1/4 degree and the required developments are discussed, with particular focus on the specification of the background-error covariances. Background-error correlations in NEMOVAR are modelled using a diffusion operator. The horizontal background-error correlations for temperature, salinity and sea ice concentration are parametrized using the Rossby radius, which produces relatively short correlation length-scales at mid to high latitudes, while a flow-dependent mixed-layer depth parametrization is used to define the vertical length-scales for the 3D variables. Results from a one-year reanalysis with NEMOVAR are presented and compared with the preceding operational data assimilation scheme at the Met Office. NEMOVAR is shown to provide significant improvements to SST, SSH and sea ice concentration fields, with the largest improvements seen in regions of high variability such as eddy shedding and frontal regions and the marginal ice zone. This improvement is associated with shorter correlation length-scales in the extratropics and an improved fit to observations in NEMOVAR. Some degradation to subsurface temperature and salinity fields where data are sparse is identified and this will be the focus of future improvements to the system.},

  abstract = {The equatorial region is a particularly challenging area for ocean data assimilation. In this region the dominant balance near the surface is between the ocean pressure gradients and the applied wind stress. When increments are applied to an ocean model near the Equator, the pressure gradients are modified and this can cause an imbalance with the unchanged wind stress. This can lead to an initialization shock where spurious equatorial waves and vertical velocities are triggered. The equatorial waves can degrade the performance of the ocean model while the increased vertical velocities have a significant negative impact on biogeochemical models forced by these physical ocean fields. Previous studies have proposed a scheme to reduce the ocean biases associated with slowly varying errors in the applied wind stress by applying a pressure correction calculated from accumulated temperature and salinity increments. This scheme has previously been shown to reduce the mean vertical velocities and improve modelled circulation. However, when applying this scheme, we still see equatorial imbalances from data assimilation on shorter time-scales. We consider a new method which is an extension of the pressure correction and aims to act as a balance to the equatorial increments and reduce intialization shock. We refer to this as an incremental pressure correction. We provide a description of this method and an analysis of its energetics. In initial experiments with a global ocean data assimilation system, this new method is shown to suppress the generation of equatorial waves in a single observation experiment and to significantly reduce the standard deviation of vertical velocities in a re-analysis experiment.},

  abstract = {ACCESS-S2 is a major upgrade to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's multi-week to seasonal prediction system. It was made operational in October 2021, replacing ACCESS-S1. The focus of the upgrade is the addition of a new weakly coupled data assimilation system to provide initial conditions for atmosphere, ocean, land and ice fields. The model is based on the UK Met Office GloSea5-GC2 seasonal prediction system and is unchanged from ACCESS-S1, aside from minor corrections and enhancements. The performance of the assimilation system and the skill of the seasonal and multi-week forecasts have been assessed and compared to ACCESS-S1. There are improvements in the ACCESS-S2 initial conditions compared to ACCESS-S1, particularly for soil moisture and aspects of the ocean, notably the ocean currents. More realistic soil moisture initialisation has led to increased skill for forecasts over Australia, especially those of maximum temperature. The ACCESS-S2 system is shown to have increased skill of El Nino--Southern Oscillation forecasts over ACCESS-S1 during the challenging autumn forecast period. Analysis suggests that ACCESS-S2 will deliver improved operational forecast accuracy in comparison to ACCESS-S1. Assessments of the operational forecasts are underway. ACCESS-S2 represents another step forward in the development of seasonal forecast systems at the Bureau of Meteorology. However, key rainfall and sea surface temperature biases in ACCESS-S1 remain in ACCESS-S2, indicating where future efforts should be focused.},

  abstract = {The net Arctic sea-ice area (SIA) can be estimated from the sea-ice concentration (SIC) by passive microwave measurements from satellites. To be a truly useful metric, for example of the sensitivity of the Arctic sea-ice cover to global warming, we need, however, reliable estimates of its uncertainty. Here we retrieve this uncertainty by taking into account the spatial and temporal error correlations of the underlying local sea-ice concentration products. As 1 example year, we find that in 2015 the average observational uncertainties of the SIA are 306 000 km2 for daily estimates, 275 000 km2 for weekly estimates, and 164 000 km2 for monthly estimates. The sea-ice extent (SIE) uncertainty for that year is slightly smaller, with 296 000 km2 for daily estimates, 261 000 km2 for weekly estimates, and 156 000 km2 for monthly estimates. These daily uncertainties correspond to about 7 \% of the 2015 sea-ice minimum and are about half of the spread in estimated SIA and SIE from different passive microwave SIC products. This shows that random SIC errors play a role in SIA uncertainties comparable to inter-SIC-product biases. We further show that the September SIA, which is traditionally the month with the least amount of Arctic sea ice, declined by 105 000{\textpm}9000 km2 a-1 for the period from 2002 to 2017. This is the first estimate of a SIA trend with an explicit representation of temporal error correlations.},

  abstract = {The latest coupled configuration of the Met Office Unified Model (Global Coupled configuration 2, GC2) is presented. This paper documents the model components which make up the configuration (although the scientific description of these components is detailed elsewhere) and provides a description of the coupling between the components. The performance of GC2 in terms of its systematic errors is assessed using a variety of diagnostic techniques. The configuration is intended to be used by the Met Office and collaborating institutes across a range of timescales, with the seasonal forecast system (GloSea5) and climate projection system (HadGEM) being the initial users. In this paper GC2 is compared against the model currently used operationally in those two systems.   Overall GC2 is shown to be an improvement on the configurations used currently, particularly in terms of modes of variability (e.g. mid-latitude and tropical cyclone intensities, the Madden--Julian Oscillation and El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation). A number of outstanding errors are identified with the most significant being a considerable warm bias over the Southern Ocean and a dry precipitation bias in the Indian and West African summer monsoons. Research to address these is ongoing.},

  abstract = {Coupled subseasonal forecast systems with dynamical sea ice have the potential of providing important predictive information in polar regions. Here, we evaluate the ability of operational ensemble prediction systems to predict the location of the sea ice edge in Antarctica. Compared to the Arctic, Antarctica shows on average a 30\% lower skill, with only one system remaining more skillful than a climatological benchmark up to {$\sim$}30 days ahead. Skill tends to be highest in the west Antarctic sector during the early freezing season. Most of the systems tend to overestimate the sea ice edge extent and fail to capture the onset of the melting season. All the forecast systems exhibit large initial errors. We conclude that subseasonal sea ice predictions could provide marginal support for decision-making only in selected seasons and regions of the Southern Ocean. However, major progress is possible through investments in model development, forecast initialization and calibration.},

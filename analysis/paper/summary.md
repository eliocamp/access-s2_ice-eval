Accurate Antarctic sea-ice forecasts are crucial for climate monitoring and operational planning, yet they remain challenging due to model biases and complex ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions. 
The two versions of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's ACCESS seasonal forecast system, +S1 and +S2, use identical model configuration and differ only in their initial conditions; primarily in that +S2 does not assimilate sea-ice observations, whereas +S1 does.   
This provides a convenient opportunistic experiment to assess the role of initial conditions on Antarctic sea-ice forecasts using more than 20 years of fully coupled simulations with two 9-member ensembles.
Our analysis reveals that both systems experience an extended melt season and delayed growth phase compared with observations. 
This leads to a significant negative sea-ice extent bias, which is corrected only in +S1 by the data assimilation system. 
The impact of the differing initial conditions on forecast errors varies dramatically by season: summer and autumn initial conditions (January-April) provide predictive skill for up to three months, with February initial conditions being particularly crucial. 
In contrast, winter forecasts of the two systems are statistically indistinguishable after only two weeks. 
Regional analysis of forecast skill suggests that this winter predictability barrier is most dramatic over East Antarctica, where even +S1 shows negative skill. 
These findings highlight the critical importance of comprehensive year-round sampling in predictability studies and suggest that operational sea-ice data assimilation efforts should prioritise the summer-autumn period when initial conditions have maximum impact on forecast skill.
